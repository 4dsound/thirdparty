After build: 

Renamed .so to .dylib.  They are actually dylibs, the output name of the build is wrong.

install_name_tool -id @rpath/liboscpack.1.1.0.dylib Release/liboscpack.1.1.0.dylib
install_name_tool -id @rpath/liboscpack.1.1.0.dylib Debug/liboscpack.1.1.0.dylib

TODO: Once dylibs are in use remove static libs in oscpack/xcode
