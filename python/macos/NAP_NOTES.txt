Built from Python-3.6.4.tar.xz

Downloader older macOS SDKs for backwards compatibility.  If you don't do this we'll be locked into the last release or two.  https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs

Configured with options:
./configure --enable-shared --enable-universalsdk=/Users/cheywood/workspaces/naivi/thirdpartybuild/MacOSX-SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk/ --prefix=`pwd`/osx-install/

# TODO flesh out configuration options, based on any missing modules below that we want

After build:

In install dir..

Set PATH_DEPENDENT_DYLIB_PATH from the Python path in otool -L bin/python3.6

chown -R `whoami` *
chmod -R +w *
install_name_tool -id @rpath/libpython3.6m.dylib lib/libpython3.6m.dylib
install_name_tool -change PATH_DEPENDENT_DYLIB_PATH @loader_path/../lib/libpython3.6m.dylib bin/python3.6
rm -r lib/python3.6/test 
rm -r lib/python3.6/tkinter

Python build finished successfully!
The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:
_gdbm                 _ssl                  ossaudiodev        
spwd                                                           
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

The following modules found by detect_modules() in setup.py, have been
built by the Makefile instead, as configured by the Setup files:
atexit                pwd                   time               

Failed to build these modules:
_lzma
