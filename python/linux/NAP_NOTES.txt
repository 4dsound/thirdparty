Built from Python-3.6.4.tar.xz on Ubuntu 16.04 with GCC 5.4.0

Configured with options:
--enable-shared

# TODO flesh out configuration options, based on any missing modules below that we want

After build:

patchelf --set-rpath \$ORIGIN/../lib bin/python3.6
patchelf --set-rpath \$ORIGIN/../lib bin/python3.6m
rm -r lib/python3.6/test
rm -r lib/python3.6/tkinter
rm lib/python3.6/config-3.6m-x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6m.a

Output:

Python build finished successfully!
The necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:
_bz2                  _curses               _curses_panel      
_dbm                  _gdbm                 _lzma              
_sqlite3              _ssl                  _tkinter           
readline                                                       
To find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.

The following modules found by detect_modules() in setup.py, have been
built by the Makefile instead, as configured by the Setup files:
atexit                pwd                   time
